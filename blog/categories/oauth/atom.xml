    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I grabbed coffee in the morning with <a href="https://github.com/oxling">Amy</a> who does iOS development at Etsy, and she gave me some incredibly helpful advice on things to be sure to focus on while I&rsquo;m at Hacker School. I left feeling excited about an idea from earlier in the batch of setting up an ad-hoc mobile network using iPhones over Bluetooth LE, and am hoping to get to work on implementing version one of that project. She also recommended contributing to a larger open-source project as a good way for someone like me who&rsquo;s always worked independently on my own apps to get used to working within someone else&rsquo;s larger code framework, which would be very relevant to doing iOS at a company where many developers are contributing to one project.</p>

<p>After talking through my OAuth handling in the Secret Handshake app with a couple of other Hacker Schoolers, and walking through each step in the OAuth process, I realized that I could handle the entire OAuth verification from within my iOS app, without relying on the external PHP file to request an access token from the server. I rewrote the OAuth handling in the app to use a custom URL scheme that redirects to my app as the Hacker School API redirect, and successfully got everything working. I wrote up an overview of the OAuth process on <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">the app&rsquo;s GitHub readme page</a>, along with the exact query parameters that are required by the API at each step.</p>

<p>Later I finished up with getting a handle on iOS&rsquo;s SpriteKit by implementing a Space Invaders game in Swift. I learned how to attach sound effects to actions in the game such as firing a bullet or a collision between two sprites on the screen (like an enemy and a bullet), how to keep score, and how to transition between different scenes in the game.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/12spaceinvadersprite.jpg" title="&lsquo;Space Invaders in Swift&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Following the repeated advice of Hacker School alumni, I decided to move on from the Space Invaders game as soon as I felt like I was no longer learning from it. I got a general sense of setting up the game play, but I stopped before making a perfect implementation of every feature in the original game. This is a big change from how I usually work&mdash; I feel a huge push to finish and perfect the work that I start, and it feels very strange and pretty luxurious to stop a project when it&rsquo;s stopped being educational for me, but after refocusing on my goals a bit yesterday I&rsquo;m impatient to learn new things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been having trouble balancing two different ways of taking full advantage of my time at Hacker School. One is that I love being around so many smart, energetic peers who I can learn from and work with, and I have such a short period of time here to have access to that. I love the energy I get from talking to other Hacker Schoolers about code and projects, and there is so much that I&rsquo;ve learned so quickly from other people here both through casual conversation over coffee and in a more formal study-group setting. I feel a lot of pressure to break out of my slightly more comfortable/habitual zone of coding alone to pair with and talk with other people at Hacker School, and to be involved in group projects that are happening around me.</p>

<p>This, combined with an impulse to grab hold of any kind of formalized workshop-style learning that&rsquo;s happening around me due to the reassurance it gives that I&rsquo;m for sure learning/accomplishing something if I participate in those, keeps leading me to participate in more formal talks/workshops that are happening in the space. It seems to reinforce my fear of missing out on learning whenever I see a group of Hacker Schoolers working through something in Hopper (the large group-work room) and I&rsquo;m not participating. It feels like skipping class.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/12hopper.jpg" title="&lsquo;Hopper&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Then I go to a bunch of workshops, and sometimes they&rsquo;re amazingly helpful and right in line with what my learning goals are here. And I think, I should go to more of these! But, other times, I realize a few minutes in that the workshop&rsquo;s focus is not furthering my goals, and I get frustrated at missing out on what could have been coding time, which feels so limited already as my time at Hacker School is flying by.</p>

<p>So, I think I need to just be more aware of the pitfalls of participating in something just because I feel like I &ldquo;should&rdquo;, and do a check with myself before I sign up for things during Hacker School hours to make sure they line up well with what I&rsquo;m already working on and interested in here.</p>

    <link href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/23/hacker-school-day-10/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-23T20:56:24-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/23/hacker-school-day-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I put a ton of time in on the <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">Secret Handshake iOS app</a> in perfecting the OAuth login procedure. Originally, I was using an OAuth library from Google to open the Hacker School login page in a webview within the app. The problem with this was that it couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of Safari&rsquo;s auto fill password functionality, or if you were already logged in on the browser.</p>

<p>I first tried to use the iOS library to post the authentication code request to the Hacker School website on Safari. Unfortunately, an iOS app is unable to do a <code>POST</code> request to another app. I ended up writing a simple PHP file on my server that I redirect the user to from the Secret Handshake app. The PHP file handles sending the user to the Hacker School login page and then sending a <code>POST</code> request to get an access token from Hacker School. It then sends the returned token back to the Secret Handshake app via a custom URL scheme <code>secrethandshake://oauth</code> and an attached query string containing the token.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/10oauthflow.png" title="&lsquo;OAuth 2.0 Process&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In the end, after struggling to find any examples of what a successful OAuth request should look like, and to find a working library I could use to get things up and running, I am not using any 3rd party libraries at all with my OAuth implementation, the code handling the OAuth requests is relatively brief, and I even managed to get token refreshing up and running to avoid repeated logins.</p>

<p>This is the PHP OAuth manager file in its entirety.</p>

<p>```php</p>

<p>&lt;?php</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Server OAuth Handler for iOS App
 *
 * iOS App launches Safari to this page on SecretHandshake server
 * This page sends the user to the Hacker School login page to get authorization code
 * It takes the auth code and sends it back to the server to get an access token
 * It redirects the user back to the app via a custom URL scheme
 * and sends the access and refresh tokens as query parameters to the app
 * which stores them for future use.
 */

function getAuthenticationUrl($auth_endpoint, $client_id, $redirect_uri)
{
    $parameters = array(
                                    'response_type' =&gt; 'code',
                                    'client_id'     =&gt; $client_id,
                                    'redirect_uri'  =&gt; $redirect_uri
                                    );
    return $auth_endpoint . '?' . http_build_query($parameters, null, '&amp;');
}

function getAccessToken($token_endpoint, $grant_type, array $parameters, $client_id, $client_secret)
{
    $parameters['grant_type'] = $grant_type;
    $parameters['client_id'] = $client_id;
    $parameters['client_secret'] = $client_secret;

    $http_headers = array();

    return executeRequest($token_endpoint, $parameters, 'POST', $http_headers, 0);
}

function executeRequest($url, $parameters = array(), $http_method = 'POST', array $http_headers = null, $form_content_type = 0)
{

    $postBody = http_build_query($parameters);
    $requestHttpContext["content"] = $postBody;
    $requestHttpContext["method"] = 'POST';

    $options = array( 'http' =&gt; $requestHttpContext );
    $context = stream_context_create( $options );

    $response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);

    return $response;

}

$client_id = 'my-client-id';
$client_secret = 'my-client-secret';
$authorization_endpoint = 'my-authorization-endpoint';
$redirect_uri = 'my-redirect-uri';
$token_endpoint = 'my-token-endpoint';


if (!isset($_GET['code']))
{
    $auth_url = getAuthenticationUrl($authorization_endpoint, $client_id, $redirect_uri);
    header('Location: ' . $auth_url);
    die('Redirect');
} else {
    $params = array(
                    'code' =&gt; $_GET['code'],
                    'redirect_uri' =&gt; $redirect_uri
                    );

    $response = getAccessToken($token_endpoint, 'authorization_code', $params, $client_id, $client_secret);

    $info = json_decode($response, true);
    $querystring = http_build_query($info);
    $appurl = 'secrethandshake://oauth' . '?' . $querystring;
    header('Location: ' . $appurl);
    die('Redirect');

}
</code></pre>

<p>?></p>

<p>```</p>

<p>On the iPhone, I capture the custom URL query string in the App Delegate.</p>

<p>```objc
&ndash; (BOOL)application:(UIApplication <em>)application openURL:(NSURL </em>)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{</p>

<pre><code>// secrethandshake://oauth?access_token=324235253442

if ([[url host] isEqualToString:@"oauth"]) {
    // parse the authentication code query
    [self authorizeFromExternalURL:url];
}

return YES;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<ul>
<li>(void)authorizeFromExternalURL:(NSURL *)url
{
  [[OAuthHandler sharedHandler] handleAuthTokenURL:url];
}
```</li>
</ul>


<p>Then I parse the query string in my OAuth Handler and store the access token and the refresh token in my user defaults.</p>

<p>``` objc
&ndash;(void)handleAuthTokenURL:(NSURL *)url
{</p>

<pre><code>// handle query here
NSDictionary *dict = [self parseQueryString:[url query]];

if ([dict objectForKey:@"error"] != nil) {
    [self.delegate oauthHandlerDidFailWithError:[dict objectForKey:@"error"]];
} else if ([dict objectForKey:@"access_token"] != nil &amp;&amp; [dict objectForKey:@"refresh_token"] != nil) {
    // Save the access token and refresh token
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[dict objectForKey:@"access_token"] forKey:kSHAccessTokenKey];
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[dict objectForKey:@"refresh_token"] forKey:kSHRefreshTokenKey];

    [self.delegate oauthHandlerDidAuthorize];
} else {
    [self.delegate oauthHandlerDidFailWithError:@"Access token not found. Failed to log in to Hacker School."];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(NSDictionary <em>)parseQueryString:(NSString </em>)query
{
  NSMutableDictionary <em>dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity:6];
  NSArray </em>pairs = [query componentsSeparatedByString:@&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;];</p>

<p>  for (NSString <em>pair in pairs) {
      NSArray </em>elements = [pair componentsSeparatedByString:@&ldquo;=&rdquo;];
      NSString <em>key = [[elements objectAtIndex:0] stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
      NSString </em>val = [[elements objectAtIndex:1] stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];</p>

<pre><code>  [dict setObject:val forKey:key];
  elements = nil;
  key = nil;
  val = nil;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  pairs = nil;
  return dict;
}</p></li>
</ul>


<p>```</p>

<p>To refresh the token, I just post to Hacker School&rsquo;s <code>/oauth/token</code> page with the query string <code>grant_type=refresh_token&amp;refresh_token=my_refresh_token</code> along with my client id and client secret, and store the new access token to sign my queries.</p>

<p>```objc
&ndash;(void)refreshToken:(id)sender
{</p>

<pre><code>NSURL *tokenURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://www.hackerschool.com/oauth/token"];
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:tokenURL];

[request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];
NSString *postString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"grant_type=refresh_token&amp;client_id=%@&amp;client_secret=%@&amp;refresh_token=%@", kMyClientID, kMyClientSecret, [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:kSHRefreshTokenKey]];
[request setHTTPBody:[postString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]];

[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:request
                                   queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue]
                       completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error) {

                           NSString *responseBody = [ [NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

                           NSLog(@"response: %@", responseBody);

                           NSData *jsonData = [responseBody dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
                           NSError *e;

                           if (e != nil) {
                               NSLog(@"error: %@", e);
                               [self launchExternalSignIn:nil];
                           } else if ([jsonDict objectForKey:@"error"] != nil){
                               NSLog(@"error refreshing token: %@", [jsonDict objectForKey:@"error"]);
                               [self launchExternalSignIn:nil];
                           } else {
                               [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[jsonDict objectForKey:@"access_token"] forKey:kSHAccessTokenKey];
                               [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:[jsonDict objectForKey:@"refresh_token"] forKey:kSHRefreshTokenKey];
                               [self.delegate oauthHandlerDidAuthorize];
                           }

                       }];

<p>It took a lot of time to get this up and running due to the lack of clear documentation on OAuth 2.0 requests, but I&rsquo;m happy with how it turned out and very happy to have gotten rid of all of the external libraries. Rewriting the entire thing in a concise way let me fully understand everything that was happening, which makes the debugging process so much simpler. Hopefully this will help someone else struggling with OAuth login from an app. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Testing the app was exciting. Several people loaded the app onto their phones and logged in, and we were all getting alerts with each others' photos, which was pretty cool. The background notifications of nearby users were working perfectly. I&rsquo;m looking into setting up <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/Vicinity">a custom implementation of iBeacon using Bluetooth LE in background mode</a> that will allow the phones to broadcast periodically in the background as well, so that no one needs to have the app open to be notified that someone is nearby.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/10notifications.jpg" title="&lsquo;SecretHandshake Notifications&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I had a great conversation with <a href="https://github.com/thomasballinger">Tom</a> in the morning about what I&rsquo;ve been working on at Hacker School and what I should focus on for the coming weeks to get the most out of it. I left feeling pretty good about the various directions I&rsquo;ve taken and how much/what/how fast I&rsquo;ve been learning. I&rsquo;m happy with the balance I&rsquo;ve had between <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/19/hacker-school-day-8/">iOS projects</a>, totally new projects (<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/11/hacker-school-day-2/">Arduino</a> and cool <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/hacker-school-day-3/">machine learning</a>/<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/hacker-school-day-4/">neural network</a> stuff), learning new languages (<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/hacker-school-day-1/">Swift!</a>), and programming basics (getting familiar with the <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/hacker-school-day-9/">data structures and algorithms</a> basics that would have been covered in CS courses had I taken that path).</p>

<p>I came away with some great new ideas for things that would be good and/or fun to focus on in the coming weeks and clearer goals for the rest of Hacker School. A side effect of being around so much creative energy and cool projects is that you can get overwhelmed with fear of missing out on what everyone else is doing, even if that&rsquo;s not what you came here to work on. Part of that is a fun and enriching distraction, like Arduino, and part of it just ends up being noise that confuses your focus. If a bunch of people are excited about writing compilers and learning Rust, should I be doing those things too?</p>

<p>I have a few ideas for some quick iOS apps that I&rsquo;d like to try to implement in Swift, that are more of a game/drawing style of app that use more math, graphics, and touch interface than the social utility apps I&rsquo;ve written in the past, which tended to take advantage of Apple&rsquo;s great built in user interface elements more than custom graphics and animations. Looking forward to the coming weeks!</p>
