    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started working on fixing some of the bugginess of the Multipeer Connectivity framework in ObjC in the morning. I tried to hack it so that Multipeer would continue working when the app was in background mode (not currently possible due to Apple&rsquo;s imposed limitations), so that we could have a count of how many people were connected to the network.</p>

<p>I also spent some time working on a problem that seems to be coming from issues with lower-level Bluetooth LE frameworks, where there are errors when trying to reconnect to the same peer multiple times after disconnecting. The issues are linked, because there can be problems rejoining the network after the backgrounded app is opened again and tries to reconnect. I suspect it has to do with sessions not fully closing from the first session when the device attempts to start a new session.</p>

<p>I got a much deeper understanding of the capabilities of Multipeer while I was walking through the code handling the sessions and peers within the network, but in the end I concluded that Multipeer is still pretty buggy. I&rsquo;m reconsidering starting with our own implementation of a mesh network in Bluetooth LE instead of using Multipeer, since it seems like Multipeer doesn&rsquo;t really allow us to avoid some of the tricky issues we were handling in CoreBluetooth, and possibly the higher-level framework gives us less power to debug and work around some of the problems. CoreBluetooth also possibly avoids some of the issues with Multipeer not working in background mode, since we can set a Bluetooth LE message to broadcast in the background, and detecting a nearby iBeacon should be able to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; an app even if it has been closed by the user.</p>

<p>I switched tasks to continue working through Programming Collective Intelligence, an amazing book on Machine Learning algorithms. It was wonderful to get into working on Machine Learning again, since it&rsquo;s what I had originally intended to focus on at Hacker School before I was swept up with Swift.</p>

<p>I worked through the chapter on Non-negative Matrix Factorization today, which was actually way more awesome than it sounds. You can scan through a bunch of articles and get word counts, just like in an earlier chapter on document classification using a naive Bayesian classifier. The Bayesian classifier used a weighted probability based on the word counts to predict which category a document belonged to out of a set of predetermined category options, and based on initial training data.</p>

<p>Non-negative Matrix Factorization is WAY cooler! It starts with the same word-count information for each article set up in a matrix, then factors the matrix into two matrices that, multiplied together, would be approximately equal to the original matrix (articles vs. words). The two factor matrices give you some really neat information about the data set, and they actually extract what the features (categories/themes) are automatically given a set number of desired features. The features can be described by which words are most likely to appear in them. So the first factor matrix has a column for each word and a row for each feature/theme/category, with each number in the matrix being the likelihood that a particular word belongs to that theme, and the second factor matrix has a row for each article and a column for each feature, and the numbers in the matrix correspond to the weight of each theme in that article.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very cool to see how some clever math and optimization can actually allow the algorithm to come up with its own categories/classes of articles (or anything else you&rsquo;re studying), without having any training data or input from the user about what is expected.</p>

<p>I have one more chapter in the book I&rsquo;ve been working through that I&rsquo;m excited to get through tomorrow, on Genetic Programming, which is all about writing programs that can actually modify themselves and evolve the code itself. Super cool!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to getting started on learning about Neural Networks more in-depth. I&rsquo;d really like to understand on a deep conceptual level what neural nets are really doing, and this online book looks like a great way to get started- <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had such a fun day! In the morning I learned how to use Arduino to control Neopixel RGB LED lights from Adafruit. It was so fast to get going with this, and the code was easy to tweak to change the patterns the lights would display.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to learn more about hardware and connecting apps to display patterns with the lights.</p>

<p>I spent some time brainstorming about Mesh Networking with a group. We want to create our own implementation of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) over Bluetooth LE, using iBeacons as a sort of push notification to alert nearby devices that messages are available, and broadcasting messages through the nodes of the network to get to the intended user.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re planning to link the mesh network up with a hardware project using the programmable RGB LED lights from Adafruit to represent the users of the network. I thought it would be cool to make a sort of giant firefly jar with light-dots flying around inside, with one dot representing each user-node of the mesh network. The ObjC iOS app would allow users to join the network and then set their dot&rsquo;s color, which would be reflected in the physical firefly jar.</p>

<p>We found a source for an affordable Bluetooth LE adapter for the Arduino and mapped out a plan for how to design the network on the whiteboard. Excited to give it a go tomorrow!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Things got much more tricky when I started trying to implement SimpleShare, my Bluetooth LE (CoreBluetooth) mesh network sharing app, in Swift, using the new Multipeer Connectivity framework instead of Bluetooth. There were much more complicated things I needed to do in Obj-C, and the app couldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;translated&rdquo; in the same way as the simpler apps just by changing to the new syntax, since Swift actually works differently in key ways than Obj-C does.</p>

<p>Things I learned about Swift:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optional variables: You can no longer have variables that aren&rsquo;t set or that are nil like you could in Obj-C. If you don&rsquo;t know what a variable is when the class is created, you have to make it an optional variable by putting a ? after the type declaration.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">MyClass</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">var</span> <span class="nl">mystring:</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Global variables: It seems that any variables you set within a class but outside of a function act like public parameters for that class and are accessible to read or set from other classes</li>
<li>Calling functions from another class: You call a function from another class by writing the class name followed by a dot then the function name with its arguments, eg:</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">someFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">someFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Init functions are a special case: Instead of calling</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>like you would for any other function, just calling</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>is how you can init an instance of a class.
* Convenience init: If your init function requires arguments to create a class instance, you can create a second init method for convenience that creates an instance with default values.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>In the afternoon, I made a plan with Jorge and Kyle to work on a mesh networking inspector to figure out the limitations of Multipeer Connectivity so that we can build a stable mesh networking messaging app. We decided to move forward on the project in Objective-C while continuing to learn Swift on the side so we can finish more quickly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First day of Hacker School! It was amazing to meet so many people who shared interests and had new ideas about programming.</p>

<p>I had planned to get to work on Machine Learning and getting comfortable with neural networks, but since the announcement of the new Swift language for iOS, there was a lot of interest in diving into learning that.</p>

<p>I learned about algebraic data structures from some other Hacker Schoolers over lunch, which was cool. I could see the recursive tree structure being a useful way to set up a decision tree in another language and will have to learn more about whether the data structures available in some other programming languages would make the machine learning algorithms possible to be coded in a more obvious, intuitive way than they are generally set up in Python.</p>

<p>I got together with a group in the afternoon to learn about Swift and the new Playgrounds Apple introduced in XCode 6. Playgrounds are cool because you can copy a snippet of code you&rsquo;re working on and see how the variables are being set and the values are changing over time as it runs through a loop.</p>

<p>I paired with Denise on getting some Swift code working. We figured out the brand-new syntax for hooking up variables to Storyboard outlets so we could generate a simple app with a button and some labels that changed text. We learned that every variable in Swift is public, as opposed to Obj-C which lets you set only certain parameters to be accessible from other classes. Once we got things going, the syntax seems much simpler and faster than all of the boilerplate code you have to write to do the same things in Obj-C.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon I worked on copying some simple demo apps I&rsquo;d written previously in Obj-C into Swift so I could get more comfortable with the new syntax. Translating the very basic apps was relatively straightforward.</p>

<p>Coolest thing from Day 0:
Emoji as variable and function names in Swift! Cutest language ever?
