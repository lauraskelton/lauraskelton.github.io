  <div class="entry-content"><p>I completely reworked my <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/imesh">ad-hoc mobile networking app</a>. It had been set up so that each time a phone had a message to send, it would advertise itself over Bluetooth LE, connect to other phones as a peripheral, send the message, then close the connection.</p>

<p>I reworked the entire process. Now, the phones are still listening most of the time for other devices, but each periodically broadcasts itself (and becomes discoverable) at random intervals every few minutes. When phones discover each other, they connect and subscribe to push notifications from each other. That way, when there is a message to send, it transmits to all connected devices in a split second.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/14adhocnetwork.gif" title="'Split Ad-Hoc Network'" ></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still some debugging to do with connection stability and perfecting the advertising interval so that devices become connected quickly, but so far it is working quite well! I&rsquo;m excited to finish getting the base network established so that I can play around with different network setups that could be built with the technology. I was intrigued by some <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/18/hacker-school-day-7/">earlier conversations about secure communications and web-of-trust networks</a>, as well as <a href="http://ghost.lesiuk.org/AdHoc/network_simulator/">different optimizations for routing the packets beyond simple broadcasting</a>, and it would be cool to use Bluetooth LE to build this.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/14adhocrouting.gif" title="'Ad-Hoc Specific Route'" ></p>

<p>We were talking about what type of photo booth would be appropriate for a Hacker School party, and I had the idea for a fun modification to the booth that would take 4 photos, turn each into ASCII art (green on a black background), and then make an animated GIF image from them that could be projected continuously during a party, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/oxling/iphone-ascii">Amy&rsquo;s ASCII Cam project</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/14asciiphoto.gif" title="'ASCII Photo'" ></p>

<p>Totally coincidentally, when checking out <a href="https://hackmanhattan.com/2014/06/facetron6000-at-figment-2014/">Hack Manhattan</a>, I came across their recent ASCII photo booth project, which takes a photo, converts it to ASCII art, then actually has an Arduino-controlled vintage typewriter type it out onto a sheet of paper for the user to take with them. So cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the Jobs Practice session on Friday and worked on the assigned project of making a quick URL shortener in 2 hours, which is practice for interview projects. I&rsquo;d never done a URL shortener before, and hadn&rsquo;t worked on web/PHP type stuff in awhile since I switched to iOS apps, so I was excited for the change of pace and the well-defined project.</p>

<p>I was confident that I could write a PHP script very quickly to do the URL shortening and routing, but as I put this up under a subdomain of an existing server I had running for another site, I had to make some tricky changes to the <code>.htaccess</code> file so that Apache would reroute all of the URLs for my shortener to the <code>index.php</code> file with all of my routing scripts. This proved trickier than I expected, since I&rsquo;m not super familiar with the syntax of the <code>.htaccess</code> file and had some trouble getting it to route things properly.</p>

<p>Finally I got the <code>.htaccess</code> file to send things to my script so I could actually write the shortener, but I&rsquo;d like to revisit it this week and learn enough that I can write that part more confidently in the future, and so that I can implement this version better than it currently is written.</p>

<p>I catch short URLs by grabbing the URL with PHP, then look up the short link in the MySQL database, and then redirect the page to the long URL.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not a short URL, then I look for <code>POST</code> variables to see if the user is trying to shorten their own URL. If so, and if it&rsquo;s a valid URL, I generate a random string of 6 characters and store them in the database with the URL they should point to.</p>

<p><a href="http://prty.us/shorten">Check it out!</a> It was cool how simple this was to implement (the PHP part at least). I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> along with a template I&rsquo;ve used previously to get something nice-looking up very quickly. It&rsquo;s also responsive (everything rearranges nicely if the screen size is smaller, like on your phone) without putting really any extra work into it, since that&rsquo;s part of Bootstrap.</p>

<p>This made me miss doing web stuff and I&rsquo;m thinking of doing more web development while I&rsquo;m here. I find that every project I make needs a good website even just for marketing, and responsive mobile-friendly websites can be a great way to extend an iOS app&rsquo;s functionality to other device platforms.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I couldn&rsquo;t get my SecretHandshake app to work properly today after the OAuth changes I&rsquo;d made, so I got to go on a bug-finding detective mission. I couldn&rsquo;t find any code I changed that would make the app suddenly never have its bluetooth delegate methods called, and a lot of error-finding logs that were never called and indicated that nothing was wrong.</p>

<p>I used Git to create a branch of the project from the last version I know for sure works, which I have on TestFlight. I built that and ran it on the device, and it still didn&rsquo;t work! At first I was frustrated, but then I realized that it meant it wasn&rsquo;t anything in the code that was the problem after all. If I built it in the XCode6 beta, it wouldn&rsquo;t ever detect other iBeacons, but if I built it in XCode5, it worked perfectly. Because I can&rsquo;t build for iOS8 from XCode5, that means that I can&rsquo;t get it to run on my iPod anymore at all. Hoping it&rsquo;s a bug in the XCode beta and not some mysterious unannounced change in the OS that breaks iBeacons.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I got to work laying out the framework for a Bluetooth LE based mobile ad-hoc mesh network using iPhones and CoreBluetooth (a lower level framework than iBeacons that allows me to send longer messages between phones). I built a simple app that lets you input a message and broadcast it to any other phones in range. It was very exciting that it works! I couldn&rsquo;t get out of range of the phones while in the Hacker School space, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to testing out whether the hopping is working (the phone that receives the message broadcasts it on to other phones).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/13mobileadhoc.jpg" title="'Mobile Ad Hoc Network'" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in pairing with some friends to figure out a network protocol that would work for sending messages between phones and for building the network. To send directed messages instead of broadcast, should there be a &ldquo;message received&rdquo; response sent by the phone when it gets there? Perhaps the &ldquo;message&rdquo; is modified in some way by each phone with headers indicating the path it successfully took to get to the intended recipient the fastest, which we could store as a way to map the network. I&rsquo;m also interested in what we had discussed earlier in linking the mesh network to a trusted friend group to allow secure messages to be sent to the people they&rsquo;re intended for.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/13weboftrust.jpg" title="'Web of Trust'" ></p>

<p>The TorCoin model for route signing by each node is inspiring me with ideas for how each node in a mobile ad hoc mesh network might sign a message such that the network could perhaps get smarter about routing messages without having to broadcast everything to each node. Maybe we could incorporate a little bit of machine learning into the Mesh Messaging app (&hellip;meshaging?) to figure out the best routes to try for reaching particular nodes.</p>

<time datetime="2014-06-25T19:37:54-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 25<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I grabbed coffee in the morning with <a href="https://github.com/oxling">Amy</a> who does iOS development at Etsy, and she gave me some incredibly helpful advice on things to be sure to focus on while I&rsquo;m at Hacker School. I left feeling excited about an idea from earlier in the batch of setting up an ad-hoc mobile network using iPhones over Bluetooth LE, and am hoping to get to work on implementing version one of that project. She also recommended contributing to a larger open-source project as a good way for someone like me who&rsquo;s always worked independently on my own apps to get used to working within someone else&rsquo;s larger code framework, which would be very relevant to doing iOS at a company where many developers are contributing to one project.</p>

<p>After talking through my OAuth handling in the Secret Handshake app with a couple of other Hacker Schoolers, and walking through each step in the OAuth process, I realized that I could handle the entire OAuth verification from within my iOS app, without relying on the external PHP file to request an access token from the server. I rewrote the OAuth handling in the app to use a custom URL scheme that redirects to my app as the Hacker School API redirect, and successfully got everything working. I wrote up an overview of the OAuth process on <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">the app&rsquo;s GitHub readme page</a>, along with the exact query parameters that are required by the API at each step.</p>

<p>Later I finished up with getting a handle on iOS&rsquo;s SpriteKit by implementing a Space Invaders game in Swift. I learned how to attach sound effects to actions in the game such as firing a bullet or a collision between two sprites on the screen (like an enemy and a bullet), how to keep score, and how to transition between different scenes in the game.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/12spaceinvadersprite.jpg" title="'Space Invaders in Swift'" ></p>

<p>Following the repeated advice of Hacker School alumni, I decided to move on from the Space Invaders game as soon as I felt like I was no longer learning from it. I got a general sense of setting up the game play, but I stopped before making a perfect implementation of every feature in the original game. This is a big change from how I usually work&mdash; I feel a huge push to finish and perfect the work that I start, and it feels very strange and pretty luxurious to stop a project when it&rsquo;s stopped being educational for me, but after refocusing on my goals a bit yesterday I&rsquo;m impatient to learn new things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been having trouble balancing two different ways of taking full advantage of my time at Hacker School. One is that I love being around so many smart, energetic peers who I can learn from and work with, and I have such a short period of time here to have access to that. I love the energy I get from talking to other Hacker Schoolers about code and projects, and there is so much that I&rsquo;ve learned so quickly from other people here both through casual conversation over coffee and in a more formal study-group setting. I feel a lot of pressure to break out of my slightly more comfortable/habitual zone of coding alone to pair with and talk with other people at Hacker School, and to be involved in group projects that are happening around me.</p>

<p>This, combined with an impulse to grab hold of any kind of formalized workshop-style learning that&rsquo;s happening around me due to the reassurance it gives that I&rsquo;m for sure learning/accomplishing something if I participate in those, keeps leading me to participate in more formal talks/workshops that are happening in the space. It seems to reinforce my fear of missing out on learning whenever I see a group of Hacker Schoolers working through something in Hopper (the large group-work room) and I&rsquo;m not participating. It feels like skipping class.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/12hopper.jpg" title="'Hopper'" ></p>

<p>Then I go to a bunch of workshops, and sometimes they&rsquo;re amazingly helpful and right in line with what my learning goals are here. And I think, I should go to more of these! But, other times, I realize a few minutes in that the workshop&rsquo;s focus is not furthering my goals, and I get frustrated at missing out on what could have been coding time, which feels so limited already as my time at Hacker School is flying by.</p>

<p>So, I think I need to just be more aware of the pitfalls of participating in something just because I feel like I &ldquo;should&rdquo;, and do a check with myself before I sign up for things during Hacker School hours to make sure they line up well with what I&rsquo;m already working on and interested in here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided Hacker School would be a great opportunity to learn some iOS frameworks I&rsquo;ve never worked with before, since I have time for something with a bit of a steeper learning curve right now than I do when I need to finish a product quickly.</p>

<p>I had an idea for a game/drawing app that would be a simple way to learn some of the animations and custom touch controls that are possible in iOS, so after learning about the different game frameworks available in iOS 8, I decided to start working through <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/42699/spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners">a SpriteKit tutorial</a> to get the hang of how to write games.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/11spritekittutorial.png" title="'Sprite Kit Tutorial'" ></p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m working in Swift, it was much trickier to get the tutorial code up and running as everything needed to be shifted over to the Swift way of thinking before I could test it out. I got a basic app up and running, but was running into some nightmarish problems with a CGPoint init method when I was doing some vector math. The problem had to do with numerical types, and I finally realized that I was mixing CGFloats with Floats, which in Swift are completely different types.</p>

<p>This is what I finally got to compile:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">let</span> <span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CGFloat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rwLength</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">))</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Because I was sending Floats to CGPoint&rsquo;s init instead of CGFloats, the following caused the compiler error &ldquo;Could not find an overload for &lsquo;init&rsquo; that accepts the supplied arguments&rdquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The following function resulted in the compiler error &ldquo;Could not find an overload for &lsquo;/&rsquo; that accepts the supplied arguments&rdquo;, because I was dividing a CGFloat by a Float, which is not allowed in Swift without first converting one of the arguments to be the same type as the other, since otherwise Swift doesn&rsquo;t know what type the output should be.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>The debugging process was pretty frustrating, but after finally figuring out what the problem was with the types I had learned a lot about how Swift works and had a stronger sense of being explicit about the types I was inputting and expecting for each function.</p>

<p>I learned about creating a game scene and adding &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; to the scene that can be anything from a label, a player, an enemy, or a projectile, and manipulating them with simple actions like move or rotate. Once I had a sense of the structure of the game, it was a lot clearer how to set up something simple. I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning more about physics and reacting to different events tomorrow.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/11spritekitorganization.png" title="'Sprite Kit Organization'" ></p>

<p>In the afternoon, Mary <a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/spaceinvaders">live-coded a Space Invaders game in Javascript</a> in under an hour. That was pretty cool to watch, and it amazes me how simple she makes the code seem. Watching her quickly create a minimum functional mock-up of the game was very helpful for me as a reminder not to get bogged down in, for example, how the Space Invaders look in version one of a game where your focus is on the functionality of the game and getting that to work. She kept this version simple by using rectangles for the player, bullets, and invaders, and that meant that she could get a basic game laid out very quickly. I like her process of development because all of the functions were laid out in a simple way, and it would be straightforward to move forward and edit some of them to add more complex game play and graphics since the basic functionality is already there.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/11spaceinvaders.png" title="'Simple Space Invaders'" ></p>

<p>Moving forward, once I finish with the SpriteKit tutorial game, I&rsquo;m going to try making a similarly simple version of Space Invaders for iOS using SpriteKit and Swift.</p>

<p>In other news, this is the coolest thing about the Q train!</p>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/99153550" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>It&rsquo;s a series of lit, painted panels on the wall of the subway tunnel between DeKalb and Canal, that&rsquo;s visible through a series of narrow slits in the tunnel wall. When the train is stopped, it just looks like bright slits, but as soon as the train starts moving, it starts animating flipbook-style. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2508-bill-brands-masstransiscope-subway-art">an installation that was put there in the 80s called Masstransiscope</a>, inspired by the Zoetrope of the 1800s. Bill Brand, the artist, had the idea that &ldquo;Instead of having the film go through the projector, you could move the audience past the film.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put a ton of time in on the <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">Secret Handshake iOS app</a> in perfecting the OAuth login procedure. Originally, I was using an OAuth library from Google to open the Hacker School login page in a webview within the app. The problem with this was that it couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of Safari&rsquo;s auto fill password functionality, or if you were already logged in on the browser.</p>

<p>I first tried to use the iOS library to post the authentication code request to the Hacker School website on Safari. Unfortunately, an iOS app is unable to do a <code>POST</code> request to another app. I ended up writing a simple PHP file on my server that I redirect the user to from the Secret Handshake app. The PHP file handles sending the user to the Hacker School login page and then sending a <code>POST</code> request to get an access token from Hacker School. It then sends the returned token back to the Secret Handshake app via a custom URL scheme <code>secrethandshake://oauth</code> and an attached query string containing the token.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/10oauthflow.png" title="'OAuth 2.0 Process'" ></p>

<p>In the end, after struggling to find any examples of what a successful OAuth request should look like, and to find a working library I could use to get things up and running, I am not using any 3rd party libraries at all with my OAuth implementation, the code handling the OAuth requests is relatively brief, and I even managed to get token refreshing up and running to avoid repeated logins.</p>

<p>This is the PHP OAuth manager file in its entirety.</p>

<p>It took a lot of time to get this up and running due to the lack of clear documentation on OAuth 2.0 requests, but I&rsquo;m happy with how it turned out and very happy to have gotten rid of all of the external libraries. Rewriting the entire thing in a concise way let me fully understand everything that was happening, which makes the debugging process so much simpler. Hopefully this will help someone else struggling with OAuth login from an app. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Testing the app was exciting. Several people loaded the app onto their phones and logged in, and we were all getting alerts with each others&#8217; photos, which was pretty cool. The background notifications of nearby users were working perfectly. I&rsquo;m looking into setting up <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/Vicinity">a custom implementation of iBeacon using Bluetooth LE in background mode</a> that will allow the phones to broadcast periodically in the background as well, so that no one needs to have the app open to be notified that someone is nearby.</p>

<p>I had a great conversation with <a href="https://github.com/thomasballinger">Tom</a> in the morning about what I&rsquo;ve been working on at Hacker School and what I should focus on for the coming weeks to get the most out of it. I left feeling pretty good about the various directions I&rsquo;ve taken and how much/what/how fast I&rsquo;ve been learning. I&rsquo;m happy with the balance I&rsquo;ve had between <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/19/hacker-school-day-8/">iOS projects</a>, totally new projects (<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/11/hacker-school-day-2/">Arduino</a> and cool <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/hacker-school-day-3/">machine learning</a>/<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/hacker-school-day-4/">neural network</a> stuff), learning new languages (<a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/hacker-school-day-1/">Swift!</a>), and programming basics (getting familiar with the <a href="http://lauraskelton.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/hacker-school-day-9/">data structures and algorithms</a> basics that would have been covered in CS courses had I taken that path).</p>

<p>I came away with some great new ideas for things that would be good and/or fun to focus on in the coming weeks and clearer goals for the rest of Hacker School. A side effect of being around so much creative energy and cool projects is that you can get overwhelmed with fear of missing out on what everyone else is doing, even if that&rsquo;s not what you came here to work on. Part of that is a fun and enriching distraction, like Arduino, and part of it just ends up being noise that confuses your focus. If a bunch of people are excited about writing compilers and learning Rust, should I be doing those things too?</p>

<p>I have a few ideas for some quick iOS apps that I&rsquo;d like to try to implement in Swift, that are more of a game/drawing style of app that use more math, graphics, and touch interface than the social utility apps I&rsquo;ve written in the past, which tended to take advantage of Apple&rsquo;s great built in user interface elements more than custom graphics and animations. Looking forward to the coming weeks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After chatting with some alums who were visiting, I decided it would be a good idea to spend some time studying Data Structures and Algorithms while I&rsquo;m at Hacker School. The great thing about being involved in a program with other people instead of learning on your own is that you become aware of some of your unknown unknowns. I can certainly teach myself things I know that I need to learn, but it&rsquo;s more challenging to know if there&rsquo;s something I need to learn that I&rsquo;ve never even heard of.</p>

<p>As I was getting ready to post a question about any books or online courses for Data Structures that folks recommended, a couple of friends walked over and started coincidentally talking about the exact same thing. We picked out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693">The Algorithm Design Manual</a> as the book we&rsquo;d work through, and put together a study group to read through it and work on the exercises together.</p>

<p>We ended up working late into the evening reading through the Data Structures section and implementing our own versions of some data structures in Apple&rsquo;s new Swift programming language. This worked wonderfully, as Swift works with XCode&rsquo;s new Playgrounds, which auto-compile code to show you right away if your code is working the way you expect it to.</p>

<p>We implemented a Swift version of a Linked List, and had some great conversations about the advantages and drawbacks of structuring some of the necessary methods in different ways, ending up with a neat implementation that took advantage of recursion to keep the code simple.</p>

<p>I learned a lot that I didn&rsquo;t know before about what an Array represents on a machine level (same-type items stored in consecutive memory locations), and how it differs from a Linked List or a Dictionary (same-type items stored in different memory locations with pointers to the next item), which explained some things about Objective-C that I hadn&rsquo;t known the reasoning behind before we started, like why empty Arrays are initialized with a capacity.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/9arraycapacity.jpg" title="'array capacity'" ></p>

<p>We also learned a much more generalized definition of a Dictionary which was interesting. It was also helpful to go through worst-case algorithm processing times, called Big O notation or Asymptotic notation. We figured out the Big O notation for various functions on an unsorted and a sorted array, and then learned that deletes on an unsorted array can be done more cleverly than we had originally thought.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/9bigo.png" title="'big o notation'" ></p>

<p>I learned about Binary Searches on sorted arrays, where instead of having to iterate through every item to find a specific value, you keep splitting the array down the middle and figuring out which half the value would be in, reducing the number of steps to find an item dramatically.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/9binarysearch.png" title="'binary search'" ></p>

<p>Later that evening, we learned about Binary Trees and the special Binary Search Trees. The Binary Search Trees work just like Binary Searches on sorted arrays, and the search is cleverly designed in the structure of the data itself. Each larger value is put into a branch node to the right, and each smaller value goes to the right. That way, to find a specific value, you have built in short-cuts as compared to an array.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/9binarysearchtree.png" title="'binary search tree'" ></p>

<p>Binary Trees might be unbalanced- if you added the values in numerical order, you would end up with just a line from the lowest value at the top to the highest value at the bottom right. The tree would be very tall, and thus it would take just as long to traverse as a regular array. The &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; of the tree, which is the distribution of values so that the right and left branches of the tree and its nodes are approximately equal, makes it possible to find values much more quickly, because each node is linked to not one but two different values, and you still know which of the links to follow simply by knowing if you are looking for a larger or smaller value. A cool trick is that if the values you are putting in can be expected to have a large degree of randomness, the tree has a high probability of being well-balanced (since subsequently-added values are equally likely to go to the left or the right of existing values, and not just all in one direction), and therefore not too tall, which will make it quickly searchable.</p>

<p>We implemented a Binary Tree structure in Swift, which was exciting because of its simplicity in code once we understood how the structure worked.</p>

<p>We kept getting an error with this version that we hadn&rsquo;t covered every possible case, and every time we added a default case or a universal pattern match, XCode would crash. After many attempts, we learned that this is actually due to a known bug in Swift that will hopefully be fixed soon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning a lot more about data structures with this group. It&rsquo;s amazing how accelerated my gaining of knowledge is in a co-learning environment like this- it&rsquo;s like the worlds&#8217; best study group that I get to work with every day. We were getting excited about putting a group together to go through some <a href="https://archive.org/details/Non-euclideanGeometry">advanced math textbooks I found online</a>, and I feel sad that Hacker School is only 3 months and I won&rsquo;t be here learning all of these things for at least the next year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished a <a href="https://github.com/lauraskelton/secrethandshake">new iPhone app</a> today!! It was inspired by someone at the Swift meetup saying that Hacker School was like the new Freemasons &ndash; some kind of secret society that instantly connected you with other people. I had such a good time talking to some Hacker School alums I hadn&rsquo;t met before, that I thought it would be good to have an app that would let me know at future meetups whether there were any other Hacker Schoolers in the room.</p>

<p>In iOS 7, Apple introduce iBeacons, a proximity beacon built on top of Bluetooth LE. IPhones can scan for iBeacon signals, and display special hyperlocal information when they come within range of one, such as at a store display or at a particular museum exhibit. The iBeacon signal can even wake up an iPhone that is inactive with an alert and a notification banner.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/8ibeacon.jpg" title="'ibeacon'" ></p>

<p>The really exciting thing is that iPhones can also act as iBeacon emitters as well as receivers. You can send out an iBeacon signal from your phone while also scanning for similar signals from other people&rsquo;s phones.</p>

<p>I set up my app so that each user&rsquo;s phone emits an iBeacon signal that includes their userID. Each phone also scans for other signals, and if it finds that of another Hacker Schooler&rsquo;s phone, it sends an alert to the scanner&rsquo;s phone and downloads a profile photo, name, and batch of the nearby person. That way, you could make sure to stop by and chat with that person at a conference or meetup.</p>

<p>So far it seems to be working well, but I definitely need beta testing help from some other Hacker School folks who wouldn&rsquo;t mind giving some feedback. I have it up on TestFlight if you have an iPhone and time to test it out! <a href="http://tflig.ht/1stcVLG">http://tflig.ht/1stcVLG</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started off working on my beer neural network a bit more. I figured out part of the problem that was giving me data that didn&rsquo;t feel right, which had to do with changing the inputs to give an incomplete picture of the outputs to force the neural network to draw more meaningful connections between the missing beer ratings and the existing beer ratings. Basically, I erased half of the beer ratings from each user from the &ldquo;input&rdquo; dataset, and left the &ldquo;output&rdquo; dataset the same, so the network would have to actually predict and couldn&rsquo;t cheat by just figuring out how to compress the ratings down to 10 nodes and then decompress them back to 900 nodes using tricky math.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7neuralnetwork.png" title="'neural network'" ></p>

<p>Now that the neural network is actually learning, I can&rsquo;t seem to get my error rate down to a level I&rsquo;m happy with. I&rsquo;m going to keep working on tweaking the parameters of the neural network to see if I can get it to output something cool that I can share.</p>

<p>While my computer was crunching away at reducing the neural network&rsquo;s error, I took a coffee break down the street with a few friends, which led to a fascinating conversation that lasted a couple of hours, mainly about Mesh Networking and Cryptocurrencies. I learned a lot about how different cryptocurrencies work, including Namecoin, which is linked to your domain name and can validate you, and another cryptocurrency that includes its own programming language that can have actually have contracts embedded in code within a transaction.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7dogecoin.png" title="'dogecoin'" ></p>

<p>We went down a pretty complicated rabbit hole of trying to figure out if there was a way to solve some problems in Mesh Networking by linking it with a cryptocurrency, either to validate the identity of nodes to allow secure communication without a centralized server (replacing SSL), or to pay central nodes for traffic they routed in order to reward mesh network users to be good citizens and stay connected to the mesh routing messages between other nodes even when they weren&rsquo;t personally using it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7torcoin.jpg" title="'torcoin'" ></p>

<p>We ended up talking about an idea to combine a social network with mesh network routing or  secure direct connections by using an app with Bluetooth LE to confirm in person that each person in my inner circle is who they say they are. Each of those people could do the same thing for their trusted friends, and then we would have a network of nodes each with a certain degree of social separation and therefore degree of trustedness which we could use to priorities routing of messages.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7weboftrust.png" title="'web of trust'" ></p>

<p>We left with some interesting ideas and a bunch of reading to do on Mesh Networking. It turns out that the idea of compensating for node bandwidth was discussed in <a href="http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/hotpets14-torpath.pdf">a recent paper about TorCoin</a>, which would be &ldquo;mined&rdquo; by routing traffic over the Tor network, and then could be sold in altcoin exchanges, encouraging good behavior on the network. We also decided to read through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network#Routing_protocols">an overview of the many previously attempted mesh network routing protocols</a> to get a clearer picture of benefits and pitfalls of different approaches. There is also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linked-The-New-Science-Networks/dp/0738206679">a book that discusses the inherent properties of many types of networks</a> that sounds like an interesting read.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7meshnetwork.jpg" title="'mesh network'" ></p>

<p>I was totally re-energized by this discussion, and decided to figure out iBeacons so I can make a fun Objective-C app for Hacker School. When I went to the Swift meetup at Etsy, almost everyone I met was excited about Hacker School, and I instantly had something to talk about with the new people I was meeting. On top of that, a few Hacker School alumni came out to the bar in Dumbo after the meetup, which was very cool. The app idea was inspired by a comment someone made that night that Hacker School was like the new Freemasons.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/7ibeacon.jpg" title="'ibeacons'" ></p>

<p>I finished up the nitty gritty late into the evening, and should have a fully working app ready for testing tomorrow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I worked on getting a visualization up of the beer neural network (with 100 beers as both inputs and outputs of the network and 10 hidden nodes) that I trained yesterday. Theoretically it should be able to take as input all of a user&rsquo;s beer ratings, and output their predicted ratings for every beer in the system.</p>

<p>I was most interested in classifying the beers and seeing what happened with the inputs to the hidden nodes- would it group certain beers together as sort of tastemakers of that node? I mapped out the top 5 positive and top 5 negative inputs to each node after it was trained onto my beer clustering map, and the results were interesting and a bit confusing. Some of the nodes made more intuitive sense than others, such as this node of someone whose defining taste predictor is that they love pale watery beers and hate Guinness and bitter IPAs.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/6node3.jpg" title="'first beernet node 3'" ></p>

<p>Some of the nodes seemed confusing and a bit random to me intuitively, although the error rate seemed pretty low which seems to indicate that there must be some meaning there. I&rsquo;m going to work tomorrow on training a new network using 900 beers instead of just the top 100 to fill in some of the gaps and nuance of the taste profiles. I actually wonder if 10 nodes was too many for only 100 beers, which would make the groupings more idiosyncratic when broader groups might be more informative. I&rsquo;m also planning to read up on Restricted Boltzmann Machines to delve into some deep learning networks.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours in the afternoon learning about testing in Javascript. This was by far the most formally directed thing I&rsquo;ve worked on at Hacker School so far. Mary gave a presentation showing a simple program in various stages along with the tests she wrote for it, so we could really see how the tests became easier to write as she refactored the code into many smaller functions. We got a chance to pair program afterwards to refactor her Javascript server code and write some tests for it. This was very helpful, and I feel much more directed now in terms of knowing some best practices for writing code.</p>

<p>I spent much of the afternoon rewriting some of my own Python code to break out some of the giant run-on functions into small pieces that I can reuse. It&rsquo;s much cleaner so far, and seems easier to follow since I can get right to a particular piece of code I need to tweak.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to cleaning up my code a LOT more. It&rsquo;s helpful to be around so many other programmers I can learn and improve from to write much cleaner, more efficient code, instead of just being happy that the program runs well with no bugs. Planning to focus a lot during Hacker School on improving in that area!</p>
